# 12 — Troubleshooting

Symptom → cause → fix.

## Display / boot

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel **oops/reboot** as soon as rbp starts | `directfbrc` missing → DirectFB takes the GPU/dri path (`panic_on_oops=1`) | install `usr/etc/directfbrc` with `no-hardware` ([06](06-display.md)) |
| UI sideways | wrong `DFB_ROTATE` | use `DFB_ROTATE=left` |
| `EINVAL` on `FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO` | 16 bpp modeset on the fixed 32 bpp DRM fb | use the patched fbdev module |
| Waveforms choppy, MOD **STATS** FPS reads ~15 | old fbdev module: per-frame debug dump and log writes, plus a second vblank wait | current `directfb-full.diff` module ([06](06-display.md#frame-rate)) |
| MOD **STATS** FPS reads ~30 | rbp's own 16 ms `usleep` limiter, then the rotate, passes vblank | current `fbshim.so` skips that one `usleep` ([06](06-display.md#frame-rate)) |
| MOD **STATS** FPS between 30 and 60 | rotate + rbp draw is close to 16.7 ms | check `/tmp/rb-rot`. Rotate should be ~4 ms. Try `DFB_ROT_THREADS=4` |
| Unit **reboots** when the player is restarted | two launchers or two rbp at once. `fix-dev.sh` used to wipe the real `/dev` | run one launcher, current scripts ([11](11-runtime-launcher.md#finding-processes-not-ps-w)) |
| `ls: /data/rbx3-run/dev/fb0: No such file` in `start-rb.log`, rbp exits | the host's `/dev/fb0` was deleted by an older `fix-dev.sh` | reboot the unit, then update `fix-dev.sh` |

## Startup / controls

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| rbp exits ~1 s after start, `crash.log` shows `[NULL+0x9c]` | `getPcController()` NULL deref | apply `scripts/patch-rbp-sclive4.py` ([03](03-port-plan.md)) |
| `sh: ls: not found` in `rbp-p.log` | chroot launched without `/bin` in `PATH` | set `PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin` |
| PLAY does nothing, CUE fires an effect | wrong MIDI channel map | decks are on MIDI ch 4/5 ([08](08-controls.md)) |
| Faders/EQs dead, PLAY works | absolute controls sent as `OP_ROTATE` | send `OP_VALUE` for fader/trim/EQ/xfader ([08](08-controls.md)) |
| Taps do nothing | `TouchCalib_User.dat` missing/wrong | install identity calib ([07](07-touch.md)) |

## USB

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Stick never detected | `usb-watch.sh` not running, or wrong bus | SC Live 4 media port is **usb1** (`USBWATCH_BUSES="1 2 3"`) ([10](10-usb.md)) |
| USB stopped working after a restart, log ends `started pid … / stopped` | the launcher missed rbp (`ps w` on 5.x) and its cleanup stopped `usb-watch` | current `start-rb.sh` ([11](11-runtime-launcher.md#finding-processes-not-ps-w)). If `/dev/sda*` is gone, reboot |
| Generic "USB1", 0 tracks after a restart | stale DeviceSQL guard/req locks | `rm -f /tmp/guard_LocalDBServer /tmp/req_LocalDBServer`, then re-notify ([10](10-usb.md)) |
| Stick ejects after ~30 s | `edisksd.service` running | stop it in the launcher |

## Audio

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No sound on the built-in speakers | audioshim opened 4 channels; speakers are ch 6/7 | 8-channel audioshim mirroring master→6/7 ([09](09-audio.md)) |
| Main/headphone distortion | S24 samples not sign-extended before gain scaling | sign-extend `(l<<8)>>8` before scaling ([09](09-audio.md)) |
| No headphone cue | cue bus (rbp device 1) not routed | route to ch 4/5 + drive `MixerEngine::setMixerChHeadphoneCue` ([09](09-audio.md)) |
| Main VU pinned at max / lags channels | wrong S24 full-scale; separate meter source | true S24 peak + rbp's own master meter ([09](09-audio.md)) |
| Phasing when cue mix is centred on the cued track | summing rbp's master + cue streams (separate ALSA devices, not sample-aligned) | route rbp's phone stream with rbp's master cue on ([09](09-audio.md)) |
| No MASTER CUE button on the SC Live 4 | XDJ-RX3 has one; SC Live 4 doesn't | strips 3/4 PFL toggle `setMasterOutHeadphoneCue` ([09](09-audio.md)) |
| Loud ~100 ms noise on the speakers at startup | codec/DSP start transient | all-channel `STARTUP_MUTE_MS` mute + fade ([09](09-audio.md)) |
| `-EBUSY` opening `hw:1,0` | `engine.service` holds the codec | stop it first |
| Occasional clicks, louder during busy screens | underruns: 2.9 ms buffer, `JuceALSA` at SCHED_OTHER | current audioshim runs the writer at SCHED_FIFO 40. Check `avail_max` ([09](09-audio.md#underruns-and-clicks)) |
| Knob volume → loud distortion | software gain on the ch 6/7 stream | run fixed `SPEAKER_GAIN=1.0` ([09](09-audio.md)) |

## Tooling / build

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `cannot find libpthread_nonshared.a` | RX3 rootfs lacks the dev archive | `scripts/shims/Makefile` creates empty stubs in `compat/` |
| `GLIBC_2.17`/`GLIBC_2.34` in a shim | linked against host glibc | link the RX3 libs; verify with `objdump -T … | grep GLIBC` |
| `tar: invalid option -- 'z'` on device | busybox tar | `zcat file.tgz \| tar x -C dir` |
| `amidi: Device or resource busy` | the shim's sequencer subscription holds the raw MIDI | capture via the shim's `KNOB_VERBOSE` log instead |
| Exec bits lost on `/bin/*` | Windows/WSL extraction | `scripts/build-chroot.sh` restores them (or `chmod -R 755`) |

## Diagnostic tools

* `tools/touchdump` (static ARM) — ILI2117 ranges + live events.
* `crashcatch.so` — on SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGFPE or SIGABRT, one line with the signal, `pc`, fault address, `lr` and `r0` to `r12` in `/tmp/crash.log`. It is not loaded by the launcher. rbp otherwise dies silently: `/data/start-rb.log` only says `stopped` and a segfault leaves nothing in `/data/rbp-p.log` (a glibc abort such as `double free` does print there). To use it, copy it to `/data/rbx3-run/usr/lib/`, put `/usr/lib/crashcatch.so` first in the `LD_PRELOAD` of the rbp line in `/data/start-rb.sh`, and restore the launcher afterwards. Map the `pc` to a function with `llvm-objdump -d` on `deploy/rbp-audio` (not PIE).
* `KNOB_VERBOSE=1` → every MIDI event + keycode in `/tmp/knobshim.log`.
* `cat /tmp/audioshim.log` — negotiated params + `sg`/peaks.
* `cat /tmp/dfbdig*.log` — DirectFB bring-up (`ROTINIT` line).
* `cat /tmp/rb-rot` — frames per 2 s, rotate avg/max µs, rbp draw µs, threads.
* `hexdump -e '17/4 "%d " "\n"' /tmp/rb-overlay | cut -d' ' -f11` — fps ×10.
* `aplay`/`amixer`/`alsactl` for audio probing. No `strace`/`gdb` on device —
  cross-build and `scp` if needed.
